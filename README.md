This app was created using React, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL.
To start the front-end, `cd` into `client` and run:

#### `npm start`

Then, to start the back-end, `cd` into `api` and again run:

#### `npm start`

These should be running concurrently across two separate terminal instances.

To set up the PostgreSQL database locally, you will need to have it installed and
configured with your own username (postgres) and a unique password 
(once these are set, you will need to configure the pool in `api/queries.js`)
From there you can create a database (again this must correspond to the pool).
To connect to the database (assuming it's named `cartography_db`) you can connect to it with:

#### `psql> \c cartography_db`

The schema can be set up from `psql`. First, `cd` into `cartography` and then from `psql` run:

#### `psql> \i seeds/tables.sql`

Once this is finished, you can optionally populate the database with some sample data:

#### `psql> \i seeds/data.sql`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
